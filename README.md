🧬 Skin Cancer Detection AI System
A professional medical AI application for skin lesion classification using ResNet50 CNN architecture with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend.

🏥 Features
Professional Medical Image Validation: Rejects non-medical images (empty pages, documents, random objects) before they reach the AI model.
Advanced Cancer Detection: ResNet50 + CNN with realistic medical analysis classifying lesions into 7 distinct categories.
Secure JWT Authentication: Custom-built token-based authentication system with secure password hashing.
Real-time Analysis: Fast skin lesion prediction with multi-class confidence scoring and color-coded risk assessment.
Persistent Database Storage: User accounts and scan history are permanently saved to a database.
Medical Recommendations: Professional post-analysis advice based on the specific predicted condition.
📋 Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have:

Python 3.11+ installed (Note: Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 will NOT work with TensorFlow)
Node.js 18+ installed
Git installed
VS Code with Python and JavaScript extensions installed
🚀 Step-by-Step Setup Guide
Step 1: Clone and Open Project
git clone https://github.com/syedasumayya/skin-cancer-detection.gitcd skin-cancer-detectioncode .
Step 2: Python Backend Setup
bash

cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: AI Model Setup
Create a folder named model_weights inside the backend folder.
Place your trained skin_cancer_model.h5 file inside model_weights/.
In backend/main.py, ensure use_simulation=False to use the real AI.
(Note: If no model file is provided, the system safely falls back to an intelligent simulation mode).
Step 4: Frontend Setup
Open a new VS Code terminal and run:

bash

cd frontend
npm install
🔧 Running the Project
Terminal 1 - Backend:

bash

cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
Should see: "✅ AI Model loaded successfully" and "✅ Server ready at http://localhost:8000"

Terminal 2 - Frontend:

bash

cd frontend
npm run dev
Should see: "Local: http://localhost:3000/"

🧪 Testing the System
1. Register/Login:
Go to http://localhost:3000. Create an account or sign in.

2. Test Image Validation:
Upload a non-medical image (a Word document, a screenshot).
Should see: "This doesn't appear to contain skin."

3. Test Cancer Detection:
Upload a close-up image of a skin lesion or mole.
Should receive detailed analysis with confidence scores.

4. Test Database Permanence:
Restart the backend server, log back in, and check the "History" tab.
Your previous scans should still be there.

🔍 Troubleshooting
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'
You are using Python 3.12+. Install Python 3.11, delete the venv folder, and recreate it using py -3.11 -m venv venv.
passlib/bcrypt ValueError
Run pip install bcrypt==4.0.1 to fix the version clash.
Frontend won't connect to Backend
Ensure the backend terminal is running on port 8000 before starting the frontend.
